| m01-049     | He rose from his breakfast-nook bench and came into the living room, where Heather and Neve stood again at his entrance. He came, almost falling forward in an ungainly shuffle, neck limp and arms dangling loosely. Then, abruptly, he drew himself up and walked on the very tips of his toes. He stretched his arms above his head and yawned agape, drawing in great breaths that became great sighs of energy. |
| m01-060     | "They have come!" he said reverently, gripping his hands together between his knees and leaning forward. "Isn't it a glorious thing! Long awaited transcendent event, The exalted desire of all Mankind through all ages! The Kingdom of The Mind is at hand!" He turned beaming eyes upward and shook his head slowly from side to side. |
| m01-079     | A superfluous precaution for there was no other car abroad; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait at an intersection for the light to change. At his apartment he garaged his car and then stood listening in the night. Listening in vain. For the earth had lost its life-tempo, as the heart loses its beat in death. |
| m01-084     | Deadly stillness, deadly portent! Steve awakened early and switched on the radio, which he kept tuned to CBO. The set lighted-up but gave only a low buzzing sound. He had just finished shaving when it came on, with a flat voice repeating: "This is BBC calling ... this is BBC calling..." |
| m01-090     | After what seemed an undue period of repetition, the voice went on to describe the humility of the Thetan colony in Sussex, in all its obscene details. Then the radio went dead again, and Steve had no stomach for breakfast. It was a beautiful day, as first-of-June should be. Steve got out of the car and traversed the same empty streets as he had the night before, to keep an appointment with Heather. |
| m01-095     | Coming around the great ramp of the Chateau barrier he braked to a screeching stop. A flying saucer was tilting and dipping over the War Memorial. There was a deep whirring sound and a high-pitched humming overtone that sang in his ears with an almost painful sharpness. He reversed and turned back on Mc Kenzie Avenue. |
| m01-104     | "The Thetans," he said, "are presumably here to take charge, as it were, of the minds of the people—who are probably falling all over themselves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry them out. Just what these orders will be, we don't know. Now, because of prior hypnosis we have escaped Thetan subjugation. This time. But we no longer have any immunity. |
| m01-110     | There can be little doubt that if the Tetians discover our mental independence they will probably give us their hypoxic treatment. If we can avoid undue prominence, it may be that we can move about pretty freely without detection. But can – well, then we may be able to promote our interests. What those interests are, beyond personal security, I haven't a clue; but, who knows, we may form the nucleus around... |
| m01-115     | Now, to summarize what I think our course of action should be: First, to avoid the Thetans like the plague, for they must not find us out! Second, to tread pretty warily among our own people, finding out just how much freedom we can take with safety. And third, to study these damned Thetans. We must learn all we can about them. |
| m01-121     | There is just a hope that we may uncover some weakness, and find a way of fighting back at them." Heather agreed, and suggested that they use Dan as a specimen demonstrating how the Phetan malformations had been working out. It occurred to Steve that this may not have been entirely an objective suggestion on her part, but he thought it a good idea nevertheless. |
| m01-125     | So they proceeded to see if the coast was clear. The street was quiet and deserted and there were neither sight nor sound of flying saucers. So they ventured forth and made their way on foot to Dan's house. Dan came to the door at their ring but neglected to offer any greeting. He was deeply preoccupied, and it seemed that the ringing of a doorbell was to him a new and strange phenomenon. |
| m01-131     | When he finally beckoned to them to enter, the action gave the impression of having been thought out and decided upon. Inside they sat down unbidden, while Don paced the floor. He seemed completely unaware of their presence. They just stared at him, turning their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and down, up and down. |
| m01-136     | His whole attitude was a mixture of impatience pending an awaited communication and of a vague perplexity respecting his surroundings and the purpose he was to serve. Finally, being so obviously on their own, Heather and Steve tried to make themselves at home. Steve switched on Dan's powerful, world-wide radio and systematically turned the tuning knob through all the tuning points of the world's great radio. |
| m01-149     | They followed him to a city bus stop on Caling Avenue, where he waited. The bus stop was a deserted island on a empty street. But not for long, for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon the Avenue from its many tributary streets. It might have been a normal business-day hustle, except for two anomalies. First, it was Sunday morning; and, second, everyone walked, or drove, or waited as a person possessed of a single all-exclusive purpose. |
| m01-160     | After a long wait a bus appeared and they followed the leaning Dan aboard, taking seats some rows behind him. He was beginning to find the stereotyped, flattish, happy faces very disconcerting; and looking at Heather he found a welcome relief in her relatively long, wistful one. |
| m02-048     | Then he would go back to Plato for a final spell of real days and would return to New York in late January or early February. Angelina might be a little sorry if we were not back for Christmas as arranged, but he consoled himself by thinking that he and Angelina would have plenty of time together in the future. And Heaven alone knew when, if ever, he would be back on Moon again, and able to do research at first hand into matters on which the future of everyone, including Angelina, depended. |
| m02-052     | The recovery of his balance was due to the fact that he was living virtually without expenses, with the people to whom Mohe had sent him. Little people who regarded him as lucky to have descended from such economic altitudes. Tom Dreyfus had a job on the machines in the Secretarial Stamp Department, while Sally sulked at home. |
| m02-055     | They had been married for six years, but the salary raise, on the expectation of which they had done so, had not materialised. "Do you know I had to send back our bedroom furniture in the second year," she moaned. She had contacts in political circles, a school-friend of hers having married Leslie Peron, a Mocrat senator with a seat on the (literally) all-powerful Rocket Release Board. |
| m02-059     | Sometimes she took Harry around with her, but never her husband, a fact he accepted as inevitable. “I guess Sally made a mistake about me,” he said one evening, when he had been left to cook his own meal. All Sally's relations were ƒmakrodeb now, but Tom was a Static Mib, the middle-income-bracket equivalent to 4sub-Pil on the lower. |
| m02-066     | All Aristotle was excited at the line, not by the prospect of the U.S. President's visit, but by a great storm in the atmosphere of the star. A mark which on Earth could hardly penetrate beyond the minds of astronomers was of general interest interest to the stars, doubtless because their habitat is not submerged beneath a deep natural atmosphere. |
| m02-069     | One wondered if this greater awareness of the physical cosmos might with time instill the reverence which, on Earth, nature inspires, especially when one reflected that the rockets over which Mr. Broom's board presided had it in their power permanently to warp the solar system. True enough, such ultimate weapons had not been used in the last the few wars, but it seemed very probable that they would be in the next one, Moon and her allies being more inferior than formerly to W.C.U. in the weapon pronounced conventional. |
| m02-072     | Lester was not home yet from his formidable duties and his wife, in the manner of middle-brow wives, romanced about him in his absence. "Lester was a country lawyer, and we were very small (unreadable word, possibly "considerable") when Sue, Sally" -here she had dropped her voice in homage to the economic system: that was revered- "when he thought we might get GO a bit better if he entered politics. |
| m02-075     | Know how he did it? He's clever on the mouth-organ. So when he visited some craterlet on Trace (ours is an agricultural Back-Face area) the cry would go up, as soon as he had spoken a few sentences of his speech: 'Cut the politics, Lester, give us something on your mouth-organ. |
| m02-080     | Sentence Database That's how he got the votes, that's how he came through to 4matrodeb status and got all these lovely things - she waved a plump hand towards her grand pianos, etc. at the same time a door banged - "but don't say a word about it, Lester wants his mouth-organ to be forgotten now. The time has come for him to be taken seriously as a statesman." |
| m02-083     | Person entered, a large man who had once been handsome but was now seedy-looking, a sufferer from stomach ulcers. In the Back-Face tradition he wore, and kept on indoors, a fifty-gallon hat. Harry was prepared for something unpleasant, for this was the Senator who had annoyed the United States by bragging how he had once won a trick from W.C.U. by threatening to loose off one of his rockets (an admission which would scarcely help bluff to succeed the next time) and, lately, by saying that if Poland troops had to come to the aid of the O.B.O. contingent in the |
| m02-087     | But privately he turned out to be as friendly as Mr. Mike the tube manufacturer, to have the same adolescent openness and freshness, though perhaps not the same maturity. One remembered that he was a lawyer by training, and suspected that the points he made so sharply in international politics were as abstract to him as those a lawyer makes in a court of law. |
| m02-090     | The motive would be the same in both cases, to serve this house of his, in which his heart lay. Here the robed man's charm was disarming. Yet when the time came to leave, Harry felt as depressed as when he left Mrs. Halliday's office, exactly a month ago. If even No statement only did what they had to do to get GO on an expanding scale, and left the sum-total of their actions, and their lunar and earthly repercussions, to luck (or to Nokes), there was a vacuum where there should be a centre of trust, responsible for the maintenance. |
| m02-095     | The political life of Aristotle looked more and more like a masquerade of business interests in dis-guise which, far from attracting the allegiance of free men everywhere, could only repel them. Then what of the cultural life? Did this per-haps nurture a genuinely civilizing impulse which might in time become social fact and counteract the erosion with economics which had grown up during the town's first two centuries? |
| m02-102     | At the centre of each circle stood personnel managers of corporations, together with professors and their filing clerks. The students had bought their college education, forward and were now being brought forward in this line. By comparing personal appearances with university records, the agents of the businesses would pick on young men and women who interested them, and contracts would be initialized at the end of the parade. |
| m02-106     | But since starting salaries would depend on grade A or B in the finals next May, and since mating prospects would depend upon salaries, scholarship for these fine young people was closely geared to economic and biological ends which essentially were really means. So, seeing them revolve in circles, Harry had the feeling that smoke (or whatever smoke consciously or unconsciously symbolised, anyway in Harry's mind) had these splendid young people by the short hairs, and was directing them... |
| m02-109     | Stepping out in their white shorts, they looked enough to be distressed, however, with the single exception of one worried little man-student who kept getting out of shape. He looked as if nothing more and his minions could do to him would ever make him Oy, but the reason probably lay in elementary neurosis and not in some eruption from those deeper layers in the human psyche which are trans-economic. |
| m02-112     | So once again the metaphysics were depressing, and in absolute contrast to the physical display. Mos have an un-American love of parades, and these young ones, on parade for jobs which they had to get off their college bills, were naturally putting their best foot forward. |
| m03-006     | "Something's up," said Lord Undertone, carefully casual, "The servants are all on edge... did you notice? And the mules didn't seem to want to get off the raft." He peered as it were into the dark secrets of the jungle. "Think there's Indians about?" It was most certainly an eerie night, exceptionally brilliant and strange, for in the proximity of the mountains, whose presence I could almost smell. |
| m03-013     | Impressive," Lord Undertone said, gazing reverently on the cosmic handiwork. "All those stars. But I'm a bit earthbound tonight, Troot. I've got a queer feeling, the I always get when something sensational's going to happen. There's things lurking if you ask me. Might be jaguar, might be... head-shrinkers. |
| m03-020     | Hope I die kind of cowped, Trout, I mean you can't imagine the Christian martyrs twisting and shrieking, no matter how bad it felt, the fire you know, or a lion munching, or arrows where it hurts most. Or can you. Look over there." He pointed to the shadows beyond the river. "Something moved. |
| m03-033     | Bottle-Foot, my lord!' 'Bottle-Foot?' His lordship may have thought I had become unbalanced through fear. 'A character Mr. Gilberte mentioned to others the other day, my lord. A being of whom the forest Indians are said to be mortally afraid, with a hoof shaped like the heel of a bottle. If your lordship will excuse me a moment... |
| m03-062     | Small, repulsive creatures they were, with black, matted hair and shining resemblance to the shrunken heads we had gazed at recently; and I have no hesitation in saying that they would have made an end of us but for an intervention so unexpected, so unusual, that only the necessity of rounding my narrative compels me to mention it. |
| m03-095     | I had a distinct impression that the hut had recently been cleaned and prepared for visitors. Mrs. Caine said we were to go no further unless and until we were sent for, confirming another impression that became more and more definite, namely, that she was in touch with an invisible source of authority. |
| m03-110     | Sally and of course Mrs Sephimus, for surely Mr Sephimus stood in the same case as myself? But was it so? I allowed myself to entertain for an instant the idea, the strange, the unwelcome, the almost inconceivable idea, that Aniadhe's arrival would be inopportune, and with the idea came a somewhat vulgar impulse, with which I refused, to watch Mr Sephimus more closely, Mrs Caine too and Mr Gilberts who would ... |
| m03-114     | But all three were to the casual observation I permitted myself unruffled; Mr. Septimus reserved and certainly very thoughtful, but that was his habit. Indeed we were all invaded by a most tranquil mood. Even the Indian servants relaxed, knowing, so Mr. Gilberto told us, that the wild and savage tribes never approached this region; at any rate, they remained with us perhaps for such protection as our presence or Mrs. | 
| m03-118     | But after what Mrs Coine had said it was never far from our minds that at any moment we were to receive a summons. I could see that Mr. Septhling was impatient for it. This afternoon, then, we climbed a promontory, a mass of clear rock crowned with trees and bushes that stood well out over the lake. |
| m04-000     | NO ONE has ever satisfactorily explained how a single-decker Welsh bus could have got itself into orbit. Shooting up over the pass a bit too carefree, and becoming airborne? Caught by a sudden gust of wind? A combination of the two? No one seems to know. But the fact remains that got itself into orbit it did. |
| m04-007     | And a fine old fuss there was about it, too. Here are the main facts. On 10th July, the bus, the 2.20 from Dinas to Llengwl, left Dinas at two-thirty-five as usual. Aboard, apart from the crew, were Mrs. Morgan Thomas and her five-year-old son Cadwallader; pretty little Morfydd Owen; Mr. Stanley Hayball and Miss. Miss Ethel Yates, blues from Birmingham; Price the Provisions; and the Rev. Edwards. |
| m04-012     | Yes, the bus set out from Dinas. So much is established. Ifor Huw Evans, Propri, watched it go from the windows of the Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. Very interested Ifor was. For there was his garage hand, Dai Pugh, taking a tearful farewell of Morfydd Owen. Morfydd who had until recently been Ifor's typist, but was now returning to her home town as a fully-fledged school teacher. |
| m04-019     | "But I'm only going fifteen miles away," Morfydd was saying. "Not the end of the world, is it?" "For me it is," Dai said wretchedly, wiping his hands on his overalls preparatory to a last embrace. "You will not be remembering amorous garage hand when you are lording it over the Mixed Infants of Llangwm!" |
| m04-024     | 'Shy boy,'" said Morfydd. Though she could not help wondering whether, now she had qualified as a school teacher, poor little Dai was quite the man for her. A nicer boy of course. But perhaps in the town would she was entering there might be boys equally nice, and with far more to offer. The conductor rang his bell. |
| m04-030     | "Good-bye, Dai," said Mafydd, smiling from the bottom stair. "Good-bye, Mafydd." He sought to enfold her in his arms. But he was too late. She was already up the bus steps, and the bus was away. And Mafydd, then, waving, unhurried from the window, did Dai, on the pavement, observing in his heart that Mafydd was leaving him as surely as she was leaving Ulnais. |
| m04-038     | So the bus set out for Llangrwl, but it never reached there! Somewhere, on those fifteen miles of mountain roads; it disappeared from the earthly scene. The first intimation that all was not well came when a Mr. Isaiah Releitz, landlord of the 'Traveller's Joy' rang up the 'Llunis Motor Omnibus Co. to ask what had happened to their damn bus. |
